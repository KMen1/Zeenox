Zeenox aims to let users have full control over the player without the need for typing commands.

- Everything important can be controlled right from the now playing message! (Back, Skip, Pause, Resume, Volume +-, Loop mode, Favorite song)
- The now playing message also shows information about the current song such as the title, length and album cover _(if available)_ as well as the volume of the player and the next 5 songs in the queue.
- The _/play_ command uses autocomplete to let you search for songs right from the chat.
- You are able to save songs to your personal playlist and play them later.
- Ability to loop songs, playlists and queue.
- Ability to shuffle, clear, reverse, remove songs or duplicates from the queue.
